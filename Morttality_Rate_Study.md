## Mortality Rate Study: Lombardia, Italy

### Summary 

The mortality rate of a disease corresponds to the number of deaths by confirmed cases. For the Covid-19, the mortality rate is around 3.4% [1], but depends on severals parameters such as the quality of the health care system or the spread of infection. Here, we studied the mortality rate in the most infected region: Lombardia in Italy. 

### Situtation in Italy

Italy represents the outbreak of the Covid-19 epidemy. It was the first country in Europe that was largely infected and the region of Lombardia has now 19884 confirmed cases and 2168 deaths (19/09/2020).

Moreover, the health care system has reached 8393 new hospitalisation due to the Covid-19. The number of bed in Intensive Care Service (ICU) was 720 in Lombardia [2]. Thus, ICU were already saturated on the 03/03/2020. It is important to notice that only 5% to 10% of hospitalisation require an ICU bed. Therfore, using the number of hospitalisation to find the date of saturation might sound incorrect. Nevertheless, 90% of ICU beds were already occupied before the Covid-19. Althought, the number of hospitalisation is not the best mean to observe the ICU saturation, it provides a relatively accurate date. 


### Case Fatality Rate

The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) represents the ratio of deaths on infected cases. Since the deaths occurs around 12 days after the infecttion the CFR is equal to the number of deaths at t+12 divided by the number of cases at t.

As one can seen the CFR was around 0.6% at the begining of the outbreak and progressively decreased to be below 0.2%. However, just after the saturation of ICU capacity, the CFR started to increase until it reached 0.8%. This would be due to the lack of bed leading to a less efficient level of health care and therefore more deaths.

### Predict the CFR

Because the number of cases and deaths are shifted of 12 days, it is not possible to calculate the CFR of the current day without predicting the
