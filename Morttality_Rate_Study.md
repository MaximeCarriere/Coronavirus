## Mortality Rate Study: Lombardia, Italy

### Summary 

The mortality rate of a disease corresponds to the number of deaths by confirmed cases. For the Covid-19, the mortality rate is around 3.4% [1], but depends on severals parameters such as the quality of the health care system or the spread of infection. Here, we studied the mortality rate in the most infected region: Lombardia in Italy. 

### Situtation in Italy

Moreover, the health care system has reached 8393 new hospitalisation due to the Covid-19. The number of bed in Intensive Care Service (ICU) was 720 in Lombardia [2]. Thus, ICU were already saturated on the 03/03/2020. It is important to notice that only 5% to 10% of hospitalisation require an ICU bed. Therfore, using the number of hospitalisation to find the date of saturation might sound incorrect. Nevertheless, 90% of ICU beds were already occupied before the Covid-19. Althought, the number of hospitalisation is not the best mean to observe the ICU saturation, it provides a relatively accurate date.
